# osk-js - On Screen Keyboard in a Web Browser

Experimental! Contains some bugs!

Popup on screen keyboard which can be used to generate keyboard events in the parent window. Special key combinations which aren't usually possible to trigger through a web browser (such as Ctrl-Alt-Del, Ctrl-Shift-R, etc) can be dispatched onto a page.

This will not function like a normal keyboard in all situations. For example, it is useless against text boxes. Its primary purpose is for sending unusual events to a web-based application.

Tip: click-and-drag out from a key to hold it down.

Tip: create a bookmarklet from osk.js
